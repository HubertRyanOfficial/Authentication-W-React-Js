# Authentication W/ReactJs

In this project you will have a simple **authentication**, you can connect using auth with standard email and password, simulating a user login to be able to show your data like e-mail, full name and random motivational phrases, and you can change your profile picture for your account. Everything with Firebase Auth, Firestore and Storage. <br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## About

With React Js, using the React Router Dom to send to others pages, navigating to other pages of the application and checking the user's status, whether connected or not.

The project depends on a google config of Firebase Auth Config Web, this configuration comes in the creation of a Firebase project, you can acquire it, below I will explain where to put this data for Firebase to know in which database the application is connected.

This layout design was completely developed from scratch to be a realistic and original application for anyone who is going to clone and use it.

## Dependencies

Below are all the dependencies that were used for this project to be completed. These three libraries were enough to make a project like this work. Firebase obviously serves as the database!

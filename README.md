# Authentication W/ReactJs

In this project you will have a simple **authentication**, you can connect using auth with standard email and password, simulating a user login to be able to show your data like e-mail, full name and random motivational phrases, and you can change your profile picture for your account. Everything with Firebase Auth, Firestore and Storage. <br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## About

With **React Js**, using the **React Router Dom** to send to others pages, navigating to other pages of the application and checking the user's status, whether connected or not.

The project depends on a google config of **Firebase Auth Config Web**, this configuration comes in the creation of a Firebase project, you can acquire it, below I will explain where to put this data for Firebase to know in which database the application is connected.

This **layout design** was completely developed from scratch to be a **realistic and original** application for anyone who is going to clone and use it.

## Dependencies

Below are all the **dependencies** that were used for this project to be completed. These three libraries were enough to make a project like this work. Firebase obviously serves as the database!

- [x] Firebase
- [x] React Router Dom
- [x] React Loader Spinner

> Important: Soon, more updates will come! Always update this repository to be able to see news like Styled Components and others.

# Getting Started

## Install

First, you need to **clone this project** to an ideal location on your computer. You can clone either using the github command line or by downloading directly from the browser or the WINRAR file, after that, extract it.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/HubertRyanOfficial/Authentication-W-React-Js.git
```

or

```sh
Download direct to you computer with WINRAR or with GitHub Desktop.
```

Second, install **all necessary project dependencies** locally so that the project can run smoothly. Of course, go to the project folder before that!

```sh
$ yarn install
```

or

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Run the project

As I said above, you need to create a **Firebase project** and get the necessary **settings for the database** to work and not return any errors. They are in the folder `src/config/database/firebaseConfig.js` you just have to change the settings that are in the constant and nothing else!

> Important: Without this configuration the application will not work!

Now just run.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

or

```sh
$ npm start
```

Now we can use and develop our project, are we going to test together with me? **Let's Go!**
